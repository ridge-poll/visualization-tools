# Experimental Event Analysis Toolkit

A Python toolbox for analyzing event-based experimental recordings and generating publication-quality visualizations.

This repository supports workflows for:
- condition-level event rate analysis
- paired comparisons within recordings
- control-normalized (delta) analysis
- statistical testing and visualization of experimental conditions

Designed for electrophysiology and imaging datasets where events are sparse and structured across recording epochs.

## Analysis Pipelines

### 1. Condition-Level Event Analysis (`paired_condition_analysis.py`)

This script performs within-dataset analysis across conditions.

**Key functions:**
- Computes event-derived metrics per recording and condition
- Calculates:
  - Event rate (events/sec)
  - Amplitude
  - Duration
  - Area under curve (AUC)
- Performs paired statistical comparisons vs a reference condition
- Produces raw-value visualizations with:
  - mean ± SEM
  - individual data points
  - significance annotations

---

### 2. Paired Delta Analysis (`paired_delta_analysis.py`)

This script computes control-normalized differences within each recording.

**Key functions:**
- Computes within-recording differences relative to control:
  - Δ Rate
  - Δ Amplitude
  - Δ Duration
  - Δ AUC
- Performs one-sample statistical tests against zero
- Focuses on effect size rather than absolute values
- Produces clearer cross-condition comparisons
- Includes baseline reference line at zero

---

## Features

- Interactive CSV file loading (file picker GUI)
- Automatic grouping by:
  - Recording
  - Condition
- Handles zero-event recordings explicitly when valid windows exist
- Derived metrics:
  - Event rate
  - Optional AUC normalization
- Statistical testing:
  - Paired t-tests (condition-level analysis)
  - One-sample t-tests (delta analysis)
- Publication-style plots:
  - bar plots with SEM
  - jittered raw data overlays
  - consistent condition color mapping
  - significance annotations

## Installation

## Usage

### Condition-level Analysis

```bash
python paired_condition_analysis.py
```
This script:
- Loads a CSV file via file picker
- Computes summary metrics per recording and condition
- Performs paired statistical comparisons against a reference condition
- Generates multi-panel plots for all metrics


### Paired Delta Analysis

```bash
python paired_delta_analysis.py
```
This script:
- Loads a CSV file via file picker
- Converts all metrics into Δ (difference-from-control) values
- Performs one-sample t-tests against zero
- Produces effect-size centered visualizations

*In effect, these two scripts produce the same p-values. The first compares a single treatment to the control, the second provides visualization for multiple treatments compared to their respective paired control.*

Notes
- Recordings must have unique identifiers so conditions can be paired correctly.
- Zero-event conditions should still be included if a recording window exists.
- In these cases, include:
  - valid Start_s and End_s
  - NaN for event-derived values (e.g., amplitude, duration, AUC)
